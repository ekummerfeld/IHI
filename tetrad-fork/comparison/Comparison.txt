Statistics:

AP = Adjacency Precision
AR = Adjacency Recall
AHP = Arrowhead precision
AHR = Arrowhead recall

Simulations:

Simulation 1: Load data sets and graphs from a directory: Linear, Gaussian SEM simulation using Graph constructed by adding random forward edges

Number of measured variables = 10.0
Number of latent variables = 0.0
Average degree of graph = 2.0
The maximum degree of the graph = 100.0
Maximum indegree of graph = 100.0
Maximum outdegree of graph = 100.0
Yes if graph should be connected = false
Minimum number of categories = 2.0
Maximum number of categories = 2.0
The number runs = 100
Yes if a different graph should be used for each run = false
Sample size = 10000.0
Please add a description to ParamDescriptions for graphsDropdownPreference = Random Foward DAG
Please add a description to ParamDescriptions for simulationsDropdownPreference = Structural Equation Model
Low end of coefficient range = 0.5
High end of coefficient range = 1.5
Low end of covariance range = 0.5
High end of covariance range = 1.5
Low end of variance range = 1.0
High end of variance range = 3.0
Yes if negative coefficient values should be considered = true
Yes if negative covariance values should be considered = true
Yes if the data should be standardized = false
Additive measurement noise variance = 0.0

Algorithms:

1. PC-Stable ("Peter and Clark" Stable), Priority Rule, using Fisher Z test, alpha = 0.01
2. CPC-Stable (Conservative "Peter and Clark" Stable), Priority Rule, using Fisher Z test, alpha = 0.01

Sorting by utility, high to low.

Weighting of statistics:

U = 

...normed to range between 0 and 1.

Note that f for each statistic is a function that maps the statistic to the 
interval [0, 1], with higher being better.

Graphs are being compared to the PAG of the true DAG.
